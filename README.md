## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

### Problem Statement
1.	Detect humans face: Haar Feature-based Cascades Classifiers by OpenCVâ€™s implement and HoG Face Detector implemented by Dlib.
2.	Detect dogs: Use a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to detect dogs in images. The model come with weights that have been trained on imageNet. 
3.	CNN model to classify dog breeds (from scratch): 
Used16 filters, 32 filters and 64 filters with 2x2 size for the convolutional layers and relu activation function to extract the information from the images. Those filters are able to collect the regional information of the image and capture lines, curves and even shape appear on the image. The Max Pooling layers along with convolutional layers is used to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network. The dropout is also used to prevent the network from overfitting. After all the convolutional layers, a regular neural network Dense layer with 250 notes is used. In the end the Softmax function is used with n notes so that the network is able to calculate the probabilities of all n categories that this image belongs to.
4.	CNN model to classify dog breeds (transfer learning):
The model uses the pre-trained VGG-16, VGG-19, RestNet-50, Inception and Xception model as a fixed feature extractor, where the last convolutional output of those pre-trained models are fed as input to our model respectively. A global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer were added, where the latter contains one node for each dog category and is equipped with a Softmax function. In the end we compare the result from each model.
